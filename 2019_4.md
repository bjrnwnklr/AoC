# Day 4

## Challenge

### Part 1

Find the number of differnt passwords for the input range, using the following rules:

- It is a six-digit number.
- The value is within the range given in your puzzle input.
- Two adjacent digits are the same (like 22 in 122345).
- Going from left to right, the digits never decrease; they only ever increase or stay the same (like 111123 or 135679).


Use a regex to find adjacent digits: 

```python
def check_adj(pw):
    regex = r'(\d)\1+'
    return True if re.search(regex, pw) else False
```

Use a lambda function to find decreasing numbers:

```python
def check_digits(pw):
    inc = lambda x: x[0] <= x[1]

    return all(map(inc, [(pw[i], pw[i+1]) for i in range(len(pw) - 1)]))

print('Part 1: ', sum((check_adj(str(pw)) and check_digits(str(pw))) for pw in range(inp_low, inp_hi + 1)))
```

This could have been achieved much quicker by just comparing if a sorted version of the pw is the same as the original version!

```python
if sorted(pw) == list(pw)
```

### Part 2

Find only numbers where adjacent numbers occur exactly twice (e.g. 111122 is ok, 123444 not).

Use `pop()` to iterate through the password.

```python
def check_adj_exact(pw):
    pwl = list(pw)
    counter = 1
    counts = []
    curr = pwl.pop()
    while pwl:
        e = pwl.pop()
        if curr == e:
            counter += 1
        else:
            counts.append(counter)
            counter = 1
            curr = e
    else:
        counts.append(counter)

    return True if 2 in counts else False
```

Again, this could have been done much simpler by just counting the occurence of each number - since valid entries are already sorted, so the same numbers are always adjacent!
