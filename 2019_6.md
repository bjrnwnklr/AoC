# Day 6

## Challenge

- Construct a graph from input pairs (directed graph)
- Count number of steps to origin from each node and sum up (part 1)
- Find shortest path between two nodes ('YOU' and 'SAN') (part 2)

### Part 1

- Generate a list of successor nodes 
- Traverse through graph from start and add previous length to origin to current node
- Sum up all lengths for all nodes using recursion:

```python
start = 'COM'

def count_graph(graph, start):
    successors = graph[start]
    for s in successors:
        o_count[s] = o_count[start] + 1
        count_graph(graph, s)

count_graph(graph, start)
```

### Part 2

Use BFS to find the shortest path in the graph between 'YOU' and 'SAN' nodes. Successfully used the BFS implementation with a `deque` from 2018.

Graph was constructed by using neighbours dictionary:

```python
neighbours = defaultdict(list)
for a, b in orbits:
    neighbours[a].append(b)
    neighbours[b].append(a)
```

A good implementation using `networkx` module: [benediktwerner](https://github.com/benediktwerner/AdventOfCode/blob/master/2019/day06/sol.py)

Another very short solution from [fuglede]():

```python
import networkx as nx


G = nx.read_edgelist('input', delimiter=')', create_using=nx.DiGraph)

# Part one
print(sum(len(nx.ancestors(G, v)) for v in G))

# Part two
print(nx.shortest_path_length(G.to_undirected(), 'YOU', 'SAN') - 2)
```
