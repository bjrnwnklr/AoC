# Day 20

## Challenge

### Part 1

- Start at AA (standing on empty tile next to AA)
- Find exit ZZ

In your maze, how many steps does it take to get from the open tile marked AA to the open tile marked ZZ?

### Parsing the grid

- read in all lines into a grid / array
- find all letters in grid
- check 4 neighbors of letter
    - if another letter: add together (left / top first, right / bottom second letter)
        - store in a dictionary of portals
    - if a '.': set location, store in a dictionary of portals as a list of locations for each portal (will have two entries)
- generate a map of portals (dictionary of start with end as result)

### Findind shortest path

BFS to traverse / map the grid, just needs to account for portals (i.e. if you step into a portal, count as 1 step and jump to next position)

**Part 1 answer: 400**
