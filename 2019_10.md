# Day 10

## Challenge

### Part 1

Read in map of asteroids (upper left corner is 0,0, first coordinate is x, 2nd coordinate is y).

- determine which asteroid has line of sight to most other asteroids
- line of sight is blocked if ratio y/x is same for asteroids (e.g. 2/3 = 4/6) -- need to see if this can be done with float numbers, or if we need to determine by multiplying denominators

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{y_1}{x_1} == \frac{y_2}{x_2} \iff \frac{y_1 x_2}{x_1 x_2} == \frac{y_2 x_1}{x_1 x_2}
\end{aligned}
$$
