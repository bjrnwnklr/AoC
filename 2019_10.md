# Day 10

## Challenge

### Part 1

Read in map of asteroids (upper left corner is 0,0, first coordinate is x, 2nd coordinate is y).

- determine which asteroid has line of sight to most other asteroids
- line of sight is blocked if ratio y/x is same for asteroids (e.g. 2/3 = 4/6) -- need to see if this can be done with float numbers, or if we need to determine by multiplying denominators

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{y_1}{x_1} == \frac{y_2}{x_2} \iff \frac{y_1 x_2}{x_1 x_2} == \frac{y_2 x_1}{x_1 x_2}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Part 2

- Laser starts _up_ and rotates clockwise.
- Laser eliminates one asteroid, then rotates on

**Find the 200th asteroid eliminated, then multiply x coordinate by 100 and add y coordinate.**

For biggest example, the destroyed asteroids are

1: 11,12
2: 12, 1
3: 12, 2
10: 12, 8
20: 16, 0
50: 16, 9
100: 10, 16
199: 9, 6
200: 8, 2
201: 10, 9
299: 11, 1
