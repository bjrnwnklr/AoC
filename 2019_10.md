# Day 10

## Challenge

### Part 1

Read in map of asteroids (upper left corner is 0,0, first coordinate is x, 2nd coordinate is y).

- determine which asteroid has line of sight to most other asteroids
- line of sight is blocked if ratio y/x is same for asteroids (e.g. 2/3 = 4/6) -- need to see if this can be done with float numbers, or if we need to determine by multiplying denominators

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{y_1}{x_1} == \frac{y_2}{x_2} \iff \frac{y_1 x_2}{x_1 x_2} == \frac{y_2 x_1}{x_1 x_2}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Part 2

- Laser starts _up_ and rotates clockwise.
- Laser eliminates one asteroid, then rotates on

**Find the 200th asteroid eliminated, then multiply x coordinate by 100 and add y coordinate.**

For biggest example, the destroyed asteroids are

1: 11,12
2: 12, 1
3: 12, 2
10: 12, 8
20: 16, 0
50: 16, 9
100: 10, 16
199: 9, 6
200: 8, 2
201: 10, 9
299: 11, 1

## Learnings

Some nice numpy usage:

1) length of vector (norm):

```python
n = np.linalg.norm(v)
n = np.linalg.norm(v, axis=1) # if v is a 2 dimensional array with vector coordinates - apply the norm to each row
```

2) unit vector of a vector (vector with length 1)

```python
def unit_vector(v):
    return v / np.linalg.norm(v)
```

3) Use `np.arctan2` to determine angle between vector and y axis

`np.arctan2(y, x)` generates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis (1, 0) and the vector with (x, y).

To get the angle between the positive y axis (0, 1) and the vector, just swap x and y: `np.arctan2(x, y)`

To get in degrees: `np.arctan2(x, y) * 180 / np.pi`

This gives back positive and negative degrees / radians (e.g. 270 degrees is returned as -90 degrees). To get positive degrees:

```python
pos_degree = ((np.arctan2(x, y) * 180 / np.pi) + 360) % 360
```
