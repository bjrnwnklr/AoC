## Challenge

### Part 1

The arcade cabinet runs _Intcode_ software like the game the Elves sent (your puzzle input). It has a primitive screen capable of drawing square tiles on a grid. The software _draws tiles to the screen with output instructions_: every _three output instructions_ specify the _x position (distance from the left)_, _y position (distance from the top)_, and _tile id_. The tile id is interpreted as follows:

- 0 is an empty tile. No game object appears in this tile.
- 1 is a wall tile. Walls are indestructible barriers.
- 2 is a block tile. Blocks can be broken by the ball.
- 3 is a horizontal paddle tile. The paddle is indestructible.
- 4 is a ball tile. The ball moves diagonally and bounces off objects.

For example, a sequence of output values like 1,2,3,6,5,4 would draw a horizontal paddle tile (1 tile from the left and 2 tiles from the top) and a ball tile (6 tiles from the left and 5 tiles from the top).

Start the game. _How many block tiles are on the screen when the game exits_?


Easy! 
- let the intcode run the input and collect all outputs in output queue
- process output queue and count all block tiles (type = 2)

Part 1: 363 block tiles!

### Part 2

- set mem address 0 to 2 to start game
- joystick can move left and right, using input instructions:
  - neutral: 0
  - tilt to the left: -1
  - tilt to the right: 1

- segment display with score:
  - if output instructions are "x=-1, y=0", the third output instruction is the current score to be displayed

beat the game by breaking all blocks - what is the score after the last block is broken?


#### So what happens when you start the game:

- Full grid is output, then a score signal, then an input is read
- each next output queue is 6 long - 1 update that a brick was destroyed, 1 update of the ball position
- after 7 rounds, another score signal is given (overall output is 12 long)

Game finishes after 10 rounds.

- So we need to track the grid and see what is left vs what is destroyed

- Ball starts at 19, 18 moving to bottom right
- paddle starts at 21, 21

- Ball will be first at 21, 20 to be reflected: do not move paddle, wait for 2 turns at 0
- Ball then comes to 27, 20 to be reflected: move to right 6 times and wait

Solution: 

Part 2: 17159 score

This was easily solved by moving the paddle in the x direction of the ball every time the ball moves. This allows the paddle to be there to reflect the ball as the ball moves at the same horizontal speed as the paddle.

Use the OutputInterrupt to process the output queue once it has 3 entries, and move the paddle every time the ball gets processed.
