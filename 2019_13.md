## Challenge

### Part 1

The arcade cabinet runs _Intcode_ software like the game the Elves sent (your puzzle input). It has a primitive screen capable of drawing square tiles on a grid. The software _draws tiles to the screen with output instructions_: every _three output instructions_ specify the _x position (distance from the left)_, _y position (distance from the top)_, and _tile id_. The tile id is interpreted as follows:

- 0 is an empty tile. No game object appears in this tile.
- 1 is a wall tile. Walls are indestructible barriers.
- 2 is a block tile. Blocks can be broken by the ball.
- 3 is a horizontal paddle tile. The paddle is indestructible.
- 4 is a ball tile. The ball moves diagonally and bounces off objects.

For example, a sequence of output values like 1,2,3,6,5,4 would draw a horizontal paddle tile (1 tile from the left and 2 tiles from the top) and a ball tile (6 tiles from the left and 5 tiles from the top).

Start the game. _How many block tiles are on the screen when the game exits_?


Easy! 
- let the intcode run the input and collect all outputs in output queue
- process output queue and count all block tiles (type = 2)

Part 1: 363 block tiles!

### Part 2

- set mem address 0 to 2 to start game
- joystick can move left and right, using input instructions:
  - neutral: 0
  - tilt to the left: -1
  - tilt to the right: 1

- segment display with score:
  - if output instructions are "x=-1, y=0", the third output instruction is the current score to be displayed

beat the game by breaking all blocks - what is the score after the last block is broken?
