# Day 15

## Challenge

### Part 1

Of course another `intcode` challenge!

The remote control program executes the following steps in a loop forever:

- Accept a movement command via an input instruction.
- Send the movement command to the repair droid.
- Wait for the repair droid to finish the movement operation.
- Report on the status of the repair droid via an output instruction.

Only four movement commands are understood: _north (1)_, _south (2)_, _west (3)_, and _east (4)_. Any other command is invalid. The movements differ in direction, but not in distance: in a long enough east-west hallway, a series of commands like 4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3 would leave the repair droid back where it started.

The repair droid can reply with any of the following status codes:

- 0: The repair droid hit a wall. Its position has not changed.
- 1: The repair droid has moved one step in the requested direction.
- 2: The repair droid has moved one step in the requested direction; its new position is the location of the oxygen system.


**What is the fewest number of movement commands required to move the repair droid from its starting position to the location of the oxygen system?**

This sounds like a BFS problem - explore the area using the intcode and generate a graph using BFS, then BFS will give the shortest path.

The problem with my first BFS implementation was that I did not use a copy of the stored intcode machine every time I explored a new neighbor from an existing node - this would then re-use the last version already used to explore a neighboring node.

The correct sequence is:
- retrieve intcode VM for current position
- **take a copy of the retrieved machine and use that for the next steps**
- Run an input / output cycle on the copy - i.e. try to move to a new location
- Retrieve the status code from the output
- Store the droid at the new location (even if it is a wall - we won't ever retrieve it again)

Since we retrieve the VM for the current position multiple times (i.e. for each neighbor), not using a copy every time changes the state of the VM after the first use as the registry of VMs stores references to the VM, so for the 2nd / 3rd neighbor, we are using the VM already used for the 1st neighbor!

Part 1: 262 steps

### Part 2

Oxygen spreads from the location of the oxygen source, 1 minute per adjacent square.

**How many minutes will it take to fill the whole area with oxygen?**

- Use BFS from the oxygen location
- What is the location furthest away - the length of the path is the duration / answer.

This was fairly easy by adding a graph into part 1 which tracks neighbors of each accesible grid cell. For part 2, run a quick BFS from the oxygen source on the graph and then find the cell with the longest path - this is the answer.

Part 2: 314 minutes

## Learnings

I learned BFS really well! Also learned how to do a "wall hugging" algorithm to map out a maze.
