## Challenge

### Part 1

Of course another `intcode` challenge!

The remote control program executes the following steps in a loop forever:

- Accept a movement command via an input instruction.
- Send the movement command to the repair droid.
- Wait for the repair droid to finish the movement operation.
- Report on the status of the repair droid via an output instruction.

Only four movement commands are understood: _north (1)_, _south (2)_, _west (3)_, and _east (4)_. Any other command is invalid. The movements differ in direction, but not in distance: in a long enough east-west hallway, a series of commands like 4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3 would leave the repair droid back where it started.

The repair droid can reply with any of the following status codes:

- 0: The repair droid hit a wall. Its position has not changed.
- 1: The repair droid has moved one step in the requested direction.
- 2: The repair droid has moved one step in the requested direction; its new position is the location of the oxygen system.


**What is the fewest number of movement commands required to move the repair droid from its starting position to the location of the oxygen system?**

This sounds like a BFS problem - explore the area using the intcode and generate a graph using BFS, then BFS will give the shortest path.

Part 1: 262 steps
