# Synacor challenge - todo


# Initial attempt

- create an example program using the example from the arch-spec
- read the challenge.bin file and see if we can extract the program from it (binary file format)
- build simple instructions, starting with 0, 19, 21. Leverage Intcode implementation as much as possible.
