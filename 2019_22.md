# Day 22

## Challenge

### Part 1

Deal space cards (numbered from 0 to 10006).

Three techniques:

Deal into new stack:
- Reverse the order of cards from top to bottom to bottom to top (e.g. 0 1 2 3 4 becomes 4 3 2 1 0)

Cut `n` cards:
- take the top N cards off the top of the deck and move them as a single unit to the bottom of the deck, retaining their order.
- e.g. cut 3 cards:
    Top          Bottom
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

    becomes

    3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2

- this can be done with negative values as well: In that case, cut (the absolute value of) N cards from the bottom of the deck onto the top


To deal with increment N:
- start by clearing enough space on your table to lay out all of the cards individually in a long line.
- Deal the top card into the leftmost position. 
- Then, move N positions to the right and deal the next card there.
- If you would move into a position past the end of the space on your table, wrap around and keep counting from the leftmost card again.
- Continue this process until you run out of cards.

Puzzle:
After shuffling your factory order deck of 10007 cards, what is the position of card 2019?


#### Parsing the file

Types of lines:

- deal with increment 7
- deal into new stack
- cut -2

each with positive or negative numbers (except for 'deal into new stack', no number).

Find key words in line:
- if "increment" in line - find number
- if "cut" in line - find number
- if "new" in line - no number

Use regex to find number.

**card 2019 is at: 6850**

### Part 2

New deck: factory order deck of 119315717514047 space cards.
You decide to apply your complete shuffle process (your puzzle input) to the deck 101741582076661 times in a row.

After shuffling your new, giant, factory order deck that many times, what number is on the card that ends up in position 2020?

#### Ideas:

- shuffle deck of cards 1 time
- see what result is at position 2020
- shuffle a few more times, see if card at 2020 repeats? Find a cycle?

This requires some complex maths (modulo arithmetics, modular inverse, exponential functions).
