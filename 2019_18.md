# Day 18

## Challenge

### Part 1

A massive underground vault. You generate a map of the tunnels (your puzzle input). The tunnels are too narrow to move diagonally.

Only one entrance (marked @) is present among the open passages (marked .) and stone walls (#), but you also detect an assortment of keys (shown as lowercase letters) and doors (shown as uppercase letters). Keys of a given letter open the door of the same letter: a opens A, b opens B, and so on. You aren't sure which key you need to disable the tractor beam, so you'll need to collect all of them.

**How many steps is the shortest path that collects all of the keys?**
