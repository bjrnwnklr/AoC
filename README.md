## Download input

You can download the day's input from this URL: https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1/input

I will document each day's learnings (what was the specific challenge, what techniques / algorithms were used to resolve). This will help with future challenges.

|  Day | Link               | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---: | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|    1 | [Day 1](2019_1.md) | Fuel levels. Using either iteration or recursion                                                                                                                                                                   |
|    2 | [Day 2](2019_2.md) | First appearane of `intcode` interpreter.                                                                                                                                                                          |
|    3 | [Day 3](2019_3.md) | Wires crossing. Using a Union between sets to find intersections. Solve part 2 by looking up index of intersection in a list; could have done also by adding number of steps into a dictionary for each gridpoint. |
|    4 | [Day 4](2019_4.md) | Finding number combinations. Some regex and clever comparisons                                                                                                                                                     |
|    5 | [Day 5](2019_5.md) | 2nd appearance of `intcode` interpreter. Some new instructions. `zfill` to pad strings with leading zeros!                                                                                                         |
|    6 | [Day 6](2019_6.md) | First graph problem. Use BFS to find shortest path. Some nice examples of using `networkx` library in the other solutions.                                                                                         |
|    7 | [Day 7](2019_7.md) | 3rd appearance of `intcode`. Introduced input and output queues and intcode machines running in a loop. Some interesting solutions to handle input / output queues using Exceptions / Interrupts                   |
