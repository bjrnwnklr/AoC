## Challenge

Using `intcode` to run a robot.

### Part 1

You'll need to build a new emergency hull painting robot. The robot needs to be able to move around on the grid of square panels on the side of your ship, detect the color of its current panel, and paint its current panel black or white. _(All of the panels are currently black.)_

The Intcode program will serve as the brain of the robot. The program uses input instructions to access the robot's camera: _provide 0 if the robot is over a black panel or 1 if the robot is over a white panel_. Then, the program will output two values:

- First, it will _output_ a value indicating the _color to paint_ the panel the robot is over: _0_ means to paint the panel _black_, and _1_ means to paint the panel _white_.
- Second, it will _output_ a value indicating the _direction the robot should turn_: _0_ means it should _turn left 90 degrees_, and _1_ means it should _turn right 90 degrees_.
- After the robot turns, it should _always move forward exactly one panel_. 
- The robot _starts facing up_.

You need to know the _number of panels it paints at least once, regardless of color_.
