# Day 24

## Challenge

### Part 1

Eris isn't a very large place; a scan of the entire area fits into a 5x5 grid (your puzzle input). The scan shows bugs (#) and empty spaces (.).

Each _minute_, The bugs live and die based on the number of bugs in the _four adjacent tiles_:

- A bug _dies_ (becoming an empty space) _unless there is exactly one bug adjacent to it_.
- An empty space becomes _infested_ with a bug _if exactly one or two bugs are adjacent to it_.

Tiles on the edges of the grid have fewer than four adjacent tiles; the missing tiles count as empty space.

This process happens in every location _simultaneously_; that is, within the same minute, _the number of adjacent bugs is counted for every tile first, and then the tiles are updated_.

To understand the nature of the bugs, _watch for the first time a layout of bugs and empty spaces matches any previous layout_. 

To calculate the _biodiversity rating_ for this layout, consider each tile left-to-right in the top row, then left-to-right in the second row, and so on. Each of these tiles is worth biodiversity points equal to _increasing powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on_. Add up the biodiversity points for tiles with bugs; in this example, the 16th tile (32768 points) and 22nd tile (2097152 points) have bugs, a total biodiversity rating of 2129920.

**What is the biodiversity rating for the first layout that appears twice?**

This is a game of life type exercise.

- read in the input
- count adjacent bugs for each tile
- generate new state
- compare to all previous states (we can use just the sum of the powers of two for this, which is also the biodiversity score)
