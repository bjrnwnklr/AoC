# Day 14

## Challenge

### Part 1

You just need to know how much ORE you'll need to collect before you can produce one unit of FUEL.

Each reaction gives specific quantities for its inputs and output; reactions cannot be partially run, so only whole integer multiples of these quantities can be used. (It's okay to have leftover chemicals when you're done, though.) For example, the reaction 1 A, 2 B, 3 C => 2 D means that exactly 2 units of chemical D can be produced by consuming exactly 1 A, 2 B and 3 C. You can run the full reaction as many times as necessary; for example, you could produce 10 D by consuming 5 A, 10 B, and 15 C.

Suppose your nanofactory produces the following list of reactions:

10 ORE => 10 A
1 ORE => 1 B
7 A, 1 B => 1 C
7 A, 1 C => 1 D
7 A, 1 D => 1 E
7 A, 1 E => 1 FUEL

1 FUEL = 7 A + 1 E = 7 A + 1 * 7 A + 1 * 1 D = 14 A + 1* 7 A + 1* 1 C = 21 A + 7 A + 1 B = 28 A + 1 ORE = 30 ORE + 1 ORE = 31 ORE

The first two reactions use only ORE as inputs; they indicate that you can produce as much of chemical A as you want (in increments of 10 units, each 10 costing 10 ORE) and as much of chemical B as you want (each costing 1 ORE). To produce 1 FUEL, a total of 31 ORE is required: 1 ORE to produce 1 B, then 30 more ORE to produce the 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 A (with 2 extra A wasted) required in the reactions to convert the B into C, C into D, D into E, and finally E into FUEL. (30 A is produced because its reaction requires that it is created in increments of 10.)

### Part 2

Given 1 trillion (1_000_000_000_000) units of ORE, how much fuel could we produce?

for Ex 3, (13312 ORE per Fuel), 82892753 FUEL units
for Ex 4, (180697 ORE per FUEL), 5586022 FUEL units
for Ex 5, (2210736 ORE per FUEL), 460664 FUEL units

This needs to take the wasteful substitutions into account - bundle together the waste and see how much additionally we could produce?

#### part 2: 3566577 fuel produced with 999999976525 ORE

## Learnings

use a generator in a list comprehension to access multiple elements of a split:

```python
# prepare input recipe
inputs = [(x[1], int(x[0])) for x in (i.split(' ') for i in inp.split(', '))]
```
