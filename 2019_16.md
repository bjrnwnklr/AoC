## Challenge

### Part 1

As input, FFT takes a list of numbers. In the signal you received (your puzzle input), each number is a single digit: data like 15243 represents the sequence 1, 5, 2, 4, 3.

FFT operates in repeated phases. In each phase, a new list is constructed with the same length as the input list. This new list is also used as the input for the next phase.

Each element in the new list is built by multiplying every value in the input list by a value in a repeating pattern and then adding up the results. So, if the input list were 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and the pattern for a given element were 1, 2, 3, the result would be 9*1 + 8*2 + 7*3 + 6*1 + 5*2 (with each input element on the left and each value in the repeating pattern on the right of each multiplication). Then, only the ones digit is kept: 38 becomes 8, -17 becomes 7, and so on.

While each element in the output array uses all of the same input array elements, the actual repeating pattern to use depends on which output element is being calculated. The base pattern is 0, 1, 0, -1. Then, repeat each value in the pattern a number of times equal to the position in the output list being considered. Repeat once for the first element, twice for the second element, three times for the third element, and so on. So, if the third element of the output list is being calculated, repeating the values would produce: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1.

When applying the pattern, skip the very first value exactly once. (In other words, offset the whole pattern left by one.) So, for the second element of the output list, the actual pattern used would be: 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, ....

After using this process to calculate each element of the output list, the phase is complete, and the output list of this phase is used as the new input list for the next phase, if any.


Algo:
- read in number and split into a list of digits
- construct repeating pattern:
  - base pattern is 0, 1, 0, -1
  - repeat each value in pattern equal to position in output list (e.g. for 2nd digit of the output, repeat each pattern element 2 times)
  - skip the first value of the pattern exactly once
- multiply elements and add up
- take only the last digit as new output value

Repeat.

Using Numpy, this is much quicker.

### Part 2

Take the input * 10000, then take the first 7 digits of the input as the offset for the solution (take the next 8 digits of the output after running 100 iterations).

There has to be a way of just calculating the a range of digits in the number without knowing the rest of the numbers!

**To get the 7th digit, you can skip calculating the first 6 digits completely.**
