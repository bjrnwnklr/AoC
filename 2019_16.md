## Challenge

### Part 1

As input, FFT takes a list of numbers. In the signal you received (your puzzle input), each number is a single digit: data like 15243 represents the sequence 1, 5, 2, 4, 3.

FFT operates in repeated phases. In each phase, a new list is constructed with the same length as the input list. This new list is also used as the input for the next phase.

Each element in the new list is built by multiplying every value in the input list by a value in a repeating pattern and then adding up the results. So, if the input list were 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and the pattern for a given element were 1, 2, 3, the result would be 9*1 + 8*2 + 7*3 + 6*1 + 5*2 (with each input element on the left and each value in the repeating pattern on the right of each multiplication). Then, only the ones digit is kept: 38 becomes 8, -17 becomes 7, and so on.

While each element in the output array uses all of the same input array elements, the actual repeating pattern to use depends on which output element is being calculated. The base pattern is 0, 1, 0, -1. Then, repeat each value in the pattern a number of times equal to the position in the output list being considered. Repeat once for the first element, twice for the second element, three times for the third element, and so on. So, if the third element of the output list is being calculated, repeating the values would produce: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1.

When applying the pattern, skip the very first value exactly once. (In other words, offset the whole pattern left by one.) So, for the second element of the output list, the actual pattern used would be: 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, ....

After using this process to calculate each element of the output list, the phase is complete, and the output list of this phase is used as the new input list for the next phase, if any.


Algo:
- read in number and split into a list of digits
- construct repeating pattern:
  - base pattern is 0, 1, 0, -1
  - repeat each value in pattern equal to position in output list (e.g. for 2nd digit of the output, repeat each pattern element 2 times)
  - skip the first value of the pattern exactly once
- multiply elements and add up
- take only the last digit as new output value

Repeat.

Using Numpy, this is much quicker.

### Part 2

Take the input * 10000, then take the first 7 digits of the input as the offset for the solution (take the 8 digits after skipping the number of offset of the output after running 100 iterations).


To try:
- length of the input (input * 10000) minus the offset - should be a fairly low number
- you only need the pattern matrix from the offset to the end (both rows and columns)
- if offset > half of the length of the input, the pattern matrix should be a upper identity matrix (1s on diagonal and upper right, 0s below diagonal), which would make the calculation really easy!

Since generating a large pattern matrix even with just ones and zeroes runs out of memory, we don't actually require this and can just sum up the lines for the number (first digit - sum up all numbers from start to end, 2nd digit, sum up from 2nd number to end etc).

Test values:

03036732577212944063491565474664 - becomes 84462026
0293510 - becomes 78725270
0308177 - becomes 53553731

**Idea: start adding up from the last number; 2nd to last number is last number + 2nd to last; 3rd to last number is 2nd to last number + 3rd to last number etc (this will avoid summing up the same numbers again and again).**

## Learnings

Numpy is very efficient for large matrix multiplications, but runs out of memory for big matrices (e.g. 500k * 500k) - might have to use Scipy sparse matrices if required.

Some handy `numpy` tools:

- `np.abs()` to get absolute value
- `np.mod(np.array, 10)` to get mod 10 of an array
- `np.ones((10, 10))` to get a 10 * 10 matrix of 1s
- `np.triu(matrix)` to get an upper matrix of 1s (0s below the diagonal)
