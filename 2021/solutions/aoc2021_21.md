# Further optimization

Improve caching by not passing in the turn, but swapping p1/s1 with p2/s2 (first two parameters are the players whose turn it is). This will require swapping the winning results around when the function returns.

Small improvement, winning score 21:

```
Elapsed time to run part2: 1.60019 seconds.
