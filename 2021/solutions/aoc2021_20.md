# Improvements to reduce runtime for AoC 2021, day 20

Runtime before optimization:

```
Elapsed time to run part1: 0.10077 seconds.
Part 1: 5400
Elapsed time to run part1: 5.49678 seconds.
Part 2: 18989
```

## Ideas

- change image format from dictionary to set
- do not recalculate the flipping infinity characters every iteration, move to the main function
- fixed increments +1 of image size (on each side) for each iteration. Only consider elements in the frame +1 in the next iteration

After optimization:

```
Elapsed time to run part1: 0.06870 seconds.
Part 1: 5400
Elapsed time to run part1: 3.72991 seconds.
Part 2: 18989
```
