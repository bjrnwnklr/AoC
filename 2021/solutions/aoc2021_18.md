# AoC 2021, day 18 - improvements

Original runtime:

```
Elapsed time to run part1: 0.58162 seconds.
Part 1: 4391
Elapsed time to run part2: 7.54579 seconds.
Part 2: 4626
```

## Ideas for improvement

- 01 use tokenized version throughout the program. Stop converting between string and tokenized version multiple times (this will likely also require a new `add` function.)
- 02 Have `split` and `explode` functions return a boolean if they made any changes. This will avoid running `split` and `explode` to check if the result is the same. Will avoid multiple runs of both functions that are not required.
- 03 clean up `split_sn` function to remove the unnecessary `else` statements.

## 02 simplify split_sn and explode functions

Minimal improvement in part 2.

```

Part 1: 4391
Elapsed time to run part2: 7.28591 seconds.
