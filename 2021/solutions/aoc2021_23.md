# Advent of Code 2021, day 23

Current Dijkstra implementation is very slow. Possible reason is the implementation of the `Burrow` class with multiple dictionaries and the `move_copy` method, which copies the dictionaries one by one.

Ideas to improve:

-   01: Use `deepcopy` of the `Burrow` class instead of manually copying.
-   02: Simplify the `Burrow` data structure:
    -   Use a `Pod` dataclass to store
        -   Type (A, B, C, D)
        -   Location (r, c)
        -   Locked status (True / False)
    -   A single `self.pods` dictionary with `id: Pod` key / value pairs
    -   This will elminate the need to have the following attributes in `Burrow`:
        -   `grid`
        -   `types`
        -   `locked`
    -   Adjust the `possible_moves` method accordingly
        -   check if path from one to another slot is clear (currently checking if hallway is all '...')
        -   locked / type lookups
    -   Adjust the `move_copy` method accordingly
        -   Only change the pod's location and locked status
    -   Adjust the `state` method accordingly
        -   Assemble the string representation as 11 + 4 + 4 dots and replace the respective slots with the pod type letters based on each pod's location
-   03: Implement `Burrow` hallway and rooms as a graph and calculate distances using a BFS (or DFS?)
-   04: Pre-calculate distances between positions (or cache them using `functools.cache`) - only do this if not implementing 03 graph.
