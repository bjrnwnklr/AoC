# AoC 2021 Day 8 notes

# Part 1

Part 1 is easy. Identify the 1 (2 segments), 4 (4 segments), 7 (3 segments) and 8 (7 segments). They are all unique.

Didn't read the instructions properly as it was so easy to find this...

# Part 2 (likely...)

The following deductions can be made from the patterns:

1. take the 2 (1) and 3 (7) length digits. The one not showing up in 3 is the aaa segment
    - aa
1. Identify the 5 (2) length by:
    - Is the only 5 length that contains a and c from 3, but not f
    - (a and f not c) are in 3 and 5 (i.e. in 2 5 digit lengths)


1, 4, 7 and 8 can be deduced from the length.

Remaining:
0: length 6
2: length 5
3: length 5
5: length 5
6: length 6
9: length 6

0 vs 6 vs 9:
- 0 and 9 both contain c and f (from 1), 6 does not contain c but f
    - identify 6
    - cc can be identified by removing all values from 8 that are in 6
- remove all values from 8 that are in 0:
    - dddd
- remove all values from 8 that are in 9:
    - ee
to distinguish between dd and ee:
- dd is in 4, ee is not
    - 9 is the one that contains the dd from 4
    - 0 is the one that contains the ee
