# Day 3

## Challenge

Wires crossing.

### Part 1

Find intersection closest to the origin. Simple use of a list to track each point we have visited. Could have used a dictionary with coordinates too.

Use a set union to find intersections between wires.

### Part 2

Find number of steps to each intersection and select the one with the smallest number of total steps required. Use list index to find distance; could have also built a dictionary with number of steps for each gridpoint from the origin.
