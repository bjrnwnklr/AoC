# Day 17

## Challenge

### Part 1

Another challenge using `intcode`. 

Running the ASCII program on your Intcode computer will provide the current view of the scaffolds. This is output, purely coincidentally, as ASCII code: 35 means #, 46 means ., 10 starts a new line of output below the current one, and so on. (Within a line, characters are drawn left-to-right.)

In the camera output, # represents a scaffold and . represents open space. The vacuum robot is visible as ^, v, <, or > depending on whether it is facing up, down, left, or right respectively. When drawn like this, the vacuum robot is always on a scaffold; if the vacuum robot ever walks off of a scaffold and begins tumbling through space uncontrollably, it will instead be visible as X.

The first step is to calibrate the cameras by getting the alignment parameters of some well-defined points. _Locate all scaffold intersections_; for each, its _alignment parameter_ is the _distance between its left edge and the left edge of the view multiplied by the distance between its top edge and the top edge of the view_. Here, the intersections from the above image are marked O:

To calibrate the cameras, you need _the sum of the alignment parameters_. 

This was easy, counting the intersections by finding neighbors:

### Part 2

- Visit each node on the scaffold at least once (probably DFS or BFS or Dijkstra!)
- change memory address 0 from 1 to 2 to start robot
- input instructions need to be provided in ASCII code (use `ord()` for this!)
- end each line of input logic with ASCII single newline, ASCII code 10
- input main movement routine
  - movement functions are A, B or C
  - separate with comma (ASCII 44)
  - end with newline (ASCII code 10)
  - 
- Movement function (A, B, C) defintions:
  - L to turn left
  - R to turn right
  - number to move forward
  - separate with commas and end with newline

- Continuous video feed:
  - provide y or n and a newline
  - may overheat intcode (it will probably output the movements)

- ASCII defintions can at most contain 20 characters, not counting the newline (but including commas - so maximum of 11 instructions)

Once finished, robot reports a last output number (non ASCII) - this is the answer to the puzzle.


#### Ideas

- explore each node using an algorithm (DFS seems reasonable?)
- Break down path into similar segments (can have maximum 3 of those, max length 11 instructions as we also need commas)
- send instructions
- receive output
