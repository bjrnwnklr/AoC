# Day 20

## Challenge

### Part 1

- Start at AA (standing on empty tile next to AA)
- Find exit ZZ

In your maze, how many steps does it take to get from the open tile marked AA to the open tile marked ZZ?

### Parsing the grid

- read in all lines into a grid / array
- find all letters in grid
- check 4 neighbors of letter
    - if another letter: add together (left / top first, right / bottom second letter)
        - store in a dictionary of portals
    - if a '.': set location, store in a dictionary of portals as a list of locations for each portal (will have two entries)
- generate a map of portals (dictionary of start with end as result)

### Findind shortest path

BFS to traverse / map the grid, just needs to account for portals (i.e. if you step into a portal, count as 1 step and jump to next position)

**Part 1 answer: 400**

### Part 2

Now the inner portals take you one level down, while the outer portals take you back up one level.

- On level 0, only the AA and ZZ portals on the outer ring work. 
- On any other level than 0, AA and ZZ are walls

Modifications required:
- Distinguish inner and outer portals
- Neighbors function needs to account for inner and outer portals, and AA/ZZ as walls if level != 0
- BFS needs to store level in addition to r, c coordinates

This worked as expected! Took ca 20 minutes to modify.

**Part 2 answer: 4986**
